Authen::Krb5::KDB is a set of perl modules to read and parse Kerberos
V5 dump files.  Currently it supports Version 3, 4 and 5 dump files.

This is an alpha release of this module so the interface could change.
If you have any suggestions, problems, or comments please email me at
the address below.


You install the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

 
The module KDB_H.pm is generated via the script gen_kdb_h.plx but
since it requires the Kerberos sources to be available it's not run
automatically from the Makefile.  The module in this distribution is
build from Kerberos Version 1.2.4 and should work on any older
versions.  If you want to rebuild the KDB_H.pm module, run the
following command with the appropriate path to your Kerberos sources:

   perl gen_kdb_h.plx /my/sources/krb5-1.2.4/src


The following modules are required:

   Carp
   POSIX
