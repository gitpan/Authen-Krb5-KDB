=head1 NAME

Authen::Krb5::KDB::V5 - objects for Kerberos V5 database V5 principals and policies


=head1 SYNOPSIS

Generally you won't load this library or call it's C<new> methods directly.
See L<Authen::Krb5::KDB> for more information.

    use Authen::Krb5::KDB::V5;

    $p = Authen::Krb5::KDB::V5->new( data => "..." );

    if ($p->type eq 'princ') {
	print $p->name, ": ", $p->fail_auth_count"\n";
    } elsif ($p->type eq 'policy') {
	print $p->name, ": ", $p->policy_refcnt, "\n";
    }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

=over 4

=item  new( data => "..." )

Parses version 5 principal and policy entries and returns the data via
an object.  Calls either C<new_princ> or C<new_policy> depending on the data.

Arguments are:

data => E<lt>stringE<gt>

Data to be parsed.  This argument is required.

checks => E<lt>levelE<gt>

Data checking level.  Level 0 means no checks; level 1 (the default)
does basic checks like checking that the lengths in the records are
correct; level 2 does much further consistency checks on the data.

lineno => E<lt>NE<gt>

Line number of the data file where this data came from (for error messages).

=back


=head2 Principals

=over 4

=item  new_princ( data => "..." )

Parses version 5 principal entries and returns the data via an object.

Arguments are:

data => E<lt>stringE<gt>

Data to be parsed.  This argument is required.

checks => E<lt>levelE<gt>

Data checking level.  Level 0 means no checks; level 1 (the default)
does basic checks like checking that the lengths in the records are
correct; level 2 does much further consistency checks on the data.

lineno => E<lt>NE<gt>

Line number of the data file where this data came from (for error messages).
